            <p>How it works: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have a certain amount of cardboard, plastic, paper, wood, concrete, etc and you need to find how to make a box or silo that will hold the most amount of material, this is the helper for you</li>
                <li>First, you enter the amount of material you have in terms of area,(i.e. cm squared, ft squared) do not enter units</li>
                <li>Then select the shape you would like to form(A box or a cylinder)</li>
                <li>Then simply click calculate and the program will calculate the measurements that will give you the greatest amount of space with the amount of material you have</li>
                <li>This uses optimization methods from Calculus </li>
            </ol>
